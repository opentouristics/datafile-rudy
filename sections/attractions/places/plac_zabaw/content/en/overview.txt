The playground was built during a major renovation of this area in 2012. Earlier it was just a swamp.
There are a few attractions designated for children, such as swings and a carousel. Nearby you can find toilets, 
tourist information, parking, ponds, cafes and a restaurant. There are also gazebos where you can take rest and a water mill.

Previously there was also a small rope park for children. Unfortunately, it was removed a few years ago :(
