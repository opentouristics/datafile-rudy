A long time ago a certain tavern in Rudy was a place where weddings, parties and
other joyful celebrations took place. These gatherings were often attended by
the young folk of Rudy and its surrounding villages and towns. It certainly was
a popular place. One time three girls came to have some fun. Nobody remembers
where exactly were they from. One of them caught an eye of a young butcher.
However, she rejected him because "he didn't look like a good man, especially
with a knife sticking out of his shoe." When the girls once again rejected him
and his companions, he threatened and insulted them. The girls, scared and
frightened, left the tavern earlier than usual. On their way home they had to
walk through the forest. The young men, whose advances they earlier turned down,
decided to follow them. The girls tried to run away; however, the offenders
managed to catch them. They were brutally murdered and their bodies were left in
the forest. As elderly people say, for a long time you could come across their
graves deep in the forest.

Today, you can find a memorial stone and a board that were put up in the memory
of those three girls.
