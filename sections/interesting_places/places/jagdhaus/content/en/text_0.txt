History

This is how the place was described in the supplement to the Oberschlesische Wanderer newspaper in 1931:



"In the deep recesses of the Ratibor Duchy forests, during these times full of chaos and unrest, 
a blissful and serene silence can still be found. On a small hill, on a glade where dense crowns of trees unravel their branches 
so that the gloom of the forest can be diffused by the light penetrating through, in these homely, simple lodges 


 so that the light can disperse the gloom of the forest, there are five straight lines
buildings made of wooden logs. The most magnificent of them is covered
a wide gable roof, from which protrudes a turret with a small bell.
The building has a terrace with a view of the forest. A charm ago
the enormous, gnarled oaks grow around the idyllic place. A bit further on
at the foot of the hill there is a soaring chapel in honor of Saint Hubert. "
