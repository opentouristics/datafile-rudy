History

This is how the place was described in the supplement to the Oberschlesische Wanderer newspaper in 1931:



"In the deep recesses of the Ratibor Duchy forests, where during these times full of chaos and unrest 
a blissful and serene silence can still be found; on a small hill, on a glade where dense crowns of trees unravel their branches 
so that the gloom of the forest can be diffused by the light penetrating through; there are five simple buildings made of logs. 
The most splendid one of them all is covered with a wide gable roof, from witch portrudes a turret with a bell inside of it. 
The building has a terrace that offers a view of the forest. The enormous and gnarled oaks surrounding it only add charm to this 
already idyllic place. A bit further at the foot of the hill there is a soaring chapel in honor of Saint Hubert."

The Jagdhaus was probably built in the mid-nineteenth century, during the reign of Victor I, Duke of Ratibor. 
Here Victor found escape from his stressful service in the parliment , hustle of a big city, the constant pursuit of wealth, 
and his lavish, but tedious live in Berlin. Together with his friends he found a place where he could finally be at peace. 
The Duke and his companions would spend a few weeks a year in these modest, decorated without unnecessary splendor but still very comfortable interiors.
They weren't intrested in the promenades of fashionable resorts. They favoured the sounds of nature, especially those of deer ruts, 
over the charms of orchestral music.


The princely entourage and all servants were accommodated in adjacent buildings. Former
also horse housing. She came to visit her husband very often
the duchess with her children. The Jagdhaus was marked by the presence of many guests.
One of them was the German poet and linguist August Heinrich Hoffmann von
Fallersleben. He is the author of the words of the German national anthem. Jagdhaus has haunted
also on the occasion of hunting in 1910, the German Emperor Wilhelm II.
The host in Rudy was then Prince Victor II Amadeus. Communal news carries
that Adolf Hitler stayed here for some time during World War II. Not
however, it is verified information.
