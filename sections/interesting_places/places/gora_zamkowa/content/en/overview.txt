This place is sometimes also called "Schlossberg" (from German: Castle Hill). 
During the reign of dukes of Ratibor, there was a viewpoint and a Victor's hut.
During the war Germans converted it into an arms depot. 
Not far away from it there once was a forester's lodge called "Lichtenstein". 

Legend has it that once upon a time a castle was built on this hill by a gang of robbers. 
They mugged merchants and other travellers that followed the old track that led to city markets. 
One time they killed a peasant who had just sold his last horse 
beacuse his family was suffering from poverty. The next morning his wife went to the forest looking for him, 
and she found her husband's dead body hanging on a tree. Her grief was so great that she yelled towards the castle: 
"let those who killed my husband suffer!" Then the earth parted and the castle fell into the abyss.

Another legend has it that there once were secret tunnels connecting the castle on a hill 
and the Cistercian monastery in Rudy.

Today the hill is a place where the foresters gather during Christmas time and sit by the fire. 
They grill sausages and have a yearly sleigh ride. 
The hill looks best in the setting sun. Seven roads connect at the top of it.
