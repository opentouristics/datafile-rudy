The chapel is situated at the junction of three forest roads, between three villages:
Szymocice, Górki Śląskie, Jankowice and the Solina railway station. It is located within the
Rudy Raciborskie Forest District, and the hunting area of the "Odyniec" hunting club. 
A perfect place to take a rest during a bicycle trip.
