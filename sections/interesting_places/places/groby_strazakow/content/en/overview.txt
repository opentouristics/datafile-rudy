In this place there are symbolic graves of two firefighters who died on 26
August 1992, during the fight against the greatest fire of post-war Poland.
Those men were Andrzej Kaczyna from Racibórz County Fire Department,
posthumously promoted to the rank of junior captain, and Andrzej Malinowski from
the Kłodnica Volunteer Fire Department.
