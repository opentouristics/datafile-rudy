The World Youth Day park alley was planted in the fall of 2016 by volunteers
from Ku≈∫nia Raciborska and surroundings. The trees planted are oaks
pedunculate, which are descendants of the mighty Cistercian oak growing in the
park in Rudy.

It is the second World Youth Day Avenue in this area. The first one stayed
planted in July 2016 in the park in Rudy.
