"Hugo Quelle" is a charming corner located in Krasiej√≥w Forestry. Hunters from
the "Odyniec" Hunting Club in Rudy restored this place several years ago. They
also built benches and tables that stand in the shade of old linden trees.
Legend has it that Hugo was a local forester, who was assigned to take care of
this area, and that water from the spring has rejuvenating properties. Before
World War II this area was fenced and used as a game breeding area.
