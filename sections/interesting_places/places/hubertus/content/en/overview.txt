One of the most famous places in local forests. The main point of this place is a wooden shelter with a small observation deck, 
located by a beautiful pond in the middle of the forest. It was built by the members of the Odyniec Hunting Club, who now, 
together with foresters from Rudy, take care of this place. Hubertus is where old oaks, hornbeams and pine trees can be found.
It's important to remember that one day the trees, just like all living organisms, will die of old age. 
This is why it is crucial to cultivate new tree stands in advance, so that they can be enjoyed by the next generations. 



Let us remember that trees, like all living organisms, will end their lives one day.
Therefore, it is very important to breed the young in advance
a generation of the forest that will be enjoyed by the next generations in a hundred or two hundred years
people. It is on Hubertus that we can closely observe young oaks, beeches and firs
and pines, which, thanks to properly performed breeding operations, cover considerable
areas of the forest. Legend has it that the pond on Hubertus was built in the place of the inn,
which centuries ago, for the sins of its owner, fell into the ground. Supposedly
sometimes, in rainy weather, you can hear human moans come out
from the depths of water.
