One of the most popular places in local forests. The main point of Hubertus is a
wooden shelter with a small observation deck, located by a beautiful pond. It
was built by the members of the Odyniec Hunting Club, who now, together with
foresters from Rudy, take care of this place. Hubertus is where old oaks,
hornbeams and pine trees can be found. It's important to remember that one day
these trees, just like all living organisms, will die of old age. This is why it
is crucial to cultivate new tree stands in advance so that the next generations
can also enjoy a beatiful forest. It is here that we can closely observe young
oaks, beeches, firs and pines, which, thanks to being sustainably cultivated,
cover significant part of the forest.

Legend has it that the pond on Hubertus was created in place of an inn that
stood there centuries ago. One day, because of the owner's terrible sins, the
inn fell into the abyss and disappeared. Supposedly sometimes when it rains, you
can hear human groans coming from the depths of water.
